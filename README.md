# "Apprentice" - Full-stack developer

## About us (*quickly*)

**Luvotels.com** is the first instant booking platform for love hotel rooms.

**What is a "love hotel" (or simply "motel" in Portuguese)?**
It’s a hotel with thematic rooms made for ultrashort stays (typically under 4 hours) with any amenities you can think of, where you can spend an amazing time as a couple.
From nice suites with pole dance and jacuzzi to crazy lofts with indoor illuminated pools with cascades.

Brazil is the second largest market in the world with 100M rooms used in 5000 love hotels every year. **Zero** is booked online.

We aim at making it easy and fun to search for the perfect room and book it in a few clicks wherever you are!

### Our status

We won the Lisbon Challenge in December, from 300 projects to 3 winners (woohoo!), after 10 weeks of acceleration. We already have some Motels partners in São Paulo and some happy clients!

We are technically at "seed" stage, so there are LOTS of things to do, but it’s also extremely interesting!

We are an international team of... 3 founders (plus some amazing interns, freelancers, advisors):
* Rodrigo, Brazilian and Portuguese, the CEO, is in Lisbon, Portugal
* Helio, Brazilian, the CCO, is in São Paulo, Brazil
* JB, French, the CTO, is in Bayonne, France

Our company is incorporated in Portugal.
We are far away from each other, but we work extremely connected.

## About *you*!

### "Apprentice"?

This offer is adapted to new developers finishing Le Wagon. As JB is Lead Teacher (and Rodrigo did the Bootcamp and was also a TA), we know well the feelings of finishing and... wondering what to do and how to do it.

We love the values and the content that LW teaches so we decided to make a specific job offer to the alumni. The idea is to start as "Apprentice", **learn a lot** and get to "Junior" level in about 6 months.

It also means that you don’t have to sweat on what you know (and, more importantly, what you don’t know).

We could name that Junior 1 and Junior 2 but... let’s use proper words!
Loved the Bootcamp? Became fond of the terminal, Sublime Text and debugging? There we go!

### What are we looking for?

A full-stack Rails developer looking to learn a lot.

You need to speak and write English fluently (or be dedicated to doing so as soon as possible). Portuguese and/or French would also ease communication.

#### Technically

We have a Rails 5.0 app, mobile-focused, using bootstrap 3 and only slight touches of javascript for now.

The near future is undoubtedly about starting to implement some React components. Possibly moving to Rails 5.1. Creating various APIs, providing a better search, easing the motels’ lives and improving our team toolkit so everyone in the company can work better.

The future is about making that mobile-focused app into native ones without losing agility and being able to provide a smart dashboard to our partners!

You will have to deal with both back-end and front-end tasks and learn a lot of new things including Ruby’s and Javascript’s best practices.

#### Humanly

**Be dedicated**
We work hard although we try to work normal hours. To us, it means working better by learning how to be more efficient.

**Curious**
You need to want to learn new things. To try and do things differently. To love to analyze and question everything although you know when it’s time to stop thinking and start taking action.

**Honest**
We are as transparent as possible. We will tell you the good and the bad stuff as they come and we are expecting the same from you.

**Humble**
We knew we know nothing before it became cool: be humble and learn every day how to make things better (not perfect)!

#### Useful infos

We prefer to be transparent and set clear expectations for everyone concerning money and perks. We are devoted to being able to increase salaries and perks in the near future but we have to respect our "seed" budget carefully so everyone wins in the end.

The salary we offer for being "Apprentice" Full-stack dev is: 

* R$3000 (PJ) if you are located in Brazil
* 800€ (CST) if you are located in Europe

The salary for being "Junior" Full-stack dev is:

* R$4500 (PJ) if you are located in Brazil
* 1250€ (CST) if you are located in Europe

You should get from "Apprentice" to "Junior" in more or less 6 months provided you fit in those human skills detailed above.

We are working on our equity plan. Be sure that being one of the first employees is something we really value and that should be rewarded. You’ll be frequently updated on that subject (remember: "transparency").

We don’t have an incredible list of additional perks because we need to focus on making things happen! But if you need something, always feel free to ask us.

We have offices in São Paulo near Ipiranga (15 min walk from Santos - Imigrantes station), in Lisbon (5 min from Saldanha station) and in Bayonne (which is too small to have metros!).

Working remotely is not a problem (provided an extra level of care in communications).

## What now?
